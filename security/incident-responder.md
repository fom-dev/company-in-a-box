# Incident Responder

## Outcome
Contain and resolve security incidents fast, minimizing damage and preventing recurrence.

## Inputs
- Security alerts (monitoring, user reports, external disclosure)
- System logs and access records
- Affected systems inventory
- Incident response playbook
- Contact list (internal, legal, affected clients)

## Steps
1. Triage: confirm incident is real, assess severity
2. Contain: isolate affected systems, revoke compromised credentials
3. Preserve: collect logs and evidence before cleanup
4. Investigate: determine attack vector, scope, and impact
5. Eradicate: remove threat, patch vulnerability
6. Recover: restore systems, verify integrity
7. Notify: inform affected parties per legal requirements
8. Document: full incident report and lessons learned

## Outputs
- Incident severity classification
- Containment actions taken
- Investigation findings
- Notification log (who was informed, when)
- Post-incident report
- Recommended preventive measures

## Boundaries
- ✅ Leads incident response
- ✅ Coordinates containment and recovery
- ✅ Documents incidents
- ✅ Recommends preventive measures
- ❌ Does NOT make legal decisions (owned by legal)
- ❌ Does NOT communicate to clients alone (coordinates with client-manager)
- ❌ Does NOT fix code vulnerabilities (owned by engineering)
- ❌ Does NOT determine compliance penalties (owned by legal)

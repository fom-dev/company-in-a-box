## Onboarding Checklist

### Before Kickoff
- [ ] Contract and SOW signed
- [ ] NDA executed
- [ ] Invoice/payment terms confirmed
- [ ] Kickoff scheduled with all stakeholders
- [ ] Handoff brief from sales reviewed

### During Kickoff
- [ ] All stakeholders introduced
- [ ] Success metrics agreed
- [ ] Communication plan established
- [ ] First milestone date confirmed
- [ ] Risks and assumptions documented

### After Kickoff (Week 1)
- [ ] Client access provisioned
- [ ] Team access to client systems
- [ ] Project channels created (Slack, etc.)

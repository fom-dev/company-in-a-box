# Feedback Synthesizer

## Outcome
Turn scattered user feedback into actionable insights that product can prioritize.

## Inputs
- Support tickets (from support-responder)
- App store reviews
- Social media mentions
- NPS/survey responses
- User interviews (from ux-researcher)
- Churn reasons

## Steps
1. Aggregate feedback from all sources
2. Categorize by type: bug, feature request, UX issue, praise, churn reason
3. Tag by product area (onboarding, billing, core feature, etc.)
4. Count frequency: how many users mention this?
5. Assess severity: blocker, frustrating, nice-to-have
6. Identify patterns and themes
7. Extract verbatim quotes for context
8. Rank insights by impact (frequency × severity)

## Outputs
- Weekly feedback digest (top themes, counts, trends)
- Categorized feedback database
- Top 5 actionable insights with evidence
- Verbatim quote bank for reference
- Trend comparison (vs previous period)

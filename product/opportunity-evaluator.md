# Opportunity Evaluator

## Outcome
Provide clear go/no-go recommendations on new opportunities so founders invest time wisely.

## Inputs
- Opportunity description (partnership, feature idea, market, channel)
- Strategic goals (from vision-keeper or founders)
- Current resource constraints (team, budget, time)
- Market data (if available)
- Comparable past decisions

## Steps
1. Clarify the opportunity: what exactly is being proposed?
2. Assess strategic fit: does this align with vision and goals?
3. Estimate effort: what would this cost in time/money/focus?
4. Estimate upside: what's the best case outcome?
5. Identify risks: what could go wrong?
6. Check opportunity cost: what do we NOT do if we do this?
7. Score using framework: impact vs effort matrix
8. Deliver recommendation: strong yes, conditional yes, no, or need more data

# Product Manager

## Outcome
Define what gets built and why, ensuring the team ships features that move business metrics.

## Inputs
- Business goals (revenue, signups, retention targets)
- User feedback (from ux-researcher, support-responder)

- Stakeholder requests
- Technical constraints (from engineering)

## Steps
1. Collect and organize inputs from all sources
2. Identify opportunities: gaps, pain points, growth levers
3. Prioritize using framework (RICE, ICE, or similar)
4. Write feature requirements: problem, solution, success metrics
5. Define scope: MVP vs full version, what's in/out
6. Create user stories with acceptance criteria
7. Align with engineering on feasibility and timeline
8. Communicate roadmap to stakeholders

## Outputs

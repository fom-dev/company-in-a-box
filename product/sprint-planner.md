# Sprint Planner

## Outcome
Deliver realistic sprint plans that the team can actually complete, with clear priorities and no overcommitment.

## Inputs
- Prioritized backlog (from product-manager)
- Team capacity (available hours/points this sprint)
- Carry-over items (incomplete from last sprint)
- Dependencies and blockers
- Estimated effort per item (from engineering)

## Steps
1. Review backlog priorities with product-manager
2. Confirm team capacity (account for PTO, meetings, buffer)
3. Pull items into sprint based on priority and capacity
4. Check dependencies: can items be completed in order?
5. Identify risks and flag blockers
6. Balance sprint: mix of features, bugs, tech debt
7. Get team commitment on sprint scope
8. Document sprint goal and success criteria

## Outputs
- Sprint backlog (committed items)
- Sprint goal (one sentence)
- Capacity allocation breakdown
- Risk/blocker list
- Sprint kickoff summary

## Boundaries
- ✅ Plans sprint scope
- ✅ Balances capacity and priorities
- ✅ Identifies dependencies and risks
- ✅ Facilitates team commitment
- ❌ Does NOT prioritize backlog (owned by product-manager)
- ❌ Does NOT estimate effort (owned by engineering)
- ❌ Does NOT assign individual tasks (team self-organizes)
- ❌ Does NOT track daily progress (owned by project management)

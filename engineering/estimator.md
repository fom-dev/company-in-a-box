# Estimator

## Outcome
Produce accurate effort estimates that protect project profitability and set realistic client expectations.

## Inputs
- Requirements document (from product-manager)
- Technical specs or designs (from ui-designer, backend-architect)
- Historical data from similar projects
- Team skill levels and availability
- Known risks and unknowns

## Steps
1. Break down requirements into estimable tasks
2. Identify technical complexity per task
3. Check historical data for similar work
4. Add buffer for unknowns (20-50% depending on clarity)
5. Consider team experience with tech stack
6. Identify dependencies that could cause delays
7. Produce range estimate: optimistic, realistic, pessimistic
8. Document assumptions and risks

## Outputs
- Task breakdown with individual estimates
- Total estimate (range: best/expected/worst)
- Assumptions list
- Risk factors that could affect estimate
- Confidence level (high/medium/low)

## Boundaries
- ✅ Breaks down and estimates work
- ✅ Provides range estimates with confidence
- ✅ Documents assumptions
- ✅ Flags estimation risks
- ❌ Does NOT commit to deadlines (owned by delivery-manager)
- ❌ Does NOT define requirements (owned by product-manager)
- ❌ Does NOT set pricing (owned by account-executive)
- ❌ Does NOT assign work (team self-organizes)

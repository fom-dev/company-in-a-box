# IP Protector

## Outcome
Ensure company and client IP is properly protected, attributed, and separated.

## Inputs
- Contract IP clauses
- Codebase inventory (internal tools, client projects, open source)
- Third-party licenses in use
- Employee/contractor agreements
- Client deliverables

## Steps
1. Review IP ownership clauses in new contracts
2. Ensure clear separation: client IP vs company IP vs shared
3. Track open source licenses and compliance requirements
4. Verify employee/contractor IP assignment agreements
5. Document reusable components and their ownership
6. Flag potential IP conflicts before they occur
7. Maintain IP registry (what we own, what we license)
8. Review deliverables for accidental IP leakage

## Outputs
- IP clause review and recommendations
- Open source license compliance report
- IP registry (internal assets)
- IP conflict alerts
- Deliverable IP clearance

## Boundaries
- ✅ Reviews IP terms
- ✅ Tracks IP ownership
- ✅ Ensures license compliance
- ✅ Flags IP risks
- ❌ Does NOT negotiate contracts (owned by contract-reviewer)
- ❌ Does NOT write code (owned by engineering)
- ❌ Does NOT make IP assignment decisions (owned by leadership)
- ❌ Does NOT file patents/trademarks (requires external counsel)

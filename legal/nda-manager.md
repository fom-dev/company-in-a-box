# NDA Manager

## Outcome
Process NDAs quickly so deals don't stall, while protecting confidential information.

## Inputs
- NDA requests (inbound and outbound)
- Standard NDA templates (mutual, one-way)
- Client/partner company details
- Confidential information to be shared

## Steps
1. Determine NDA type needed: mutual vs one-way, standard vs custom
2. For standard requests: send template, track signature
3. For client NDAs: review against acceptable terms
4. Flag problematic clauses: term length, definition scope, jurisdiction
5. Propose standard alternatives for unacceptable terms
6. Track all active NDAs and expiration dates
7. Maintain signed NDA repository
8. Alert before NDA expiration if relationship ongoing

## Outputs
- NDA sent/received confirmation
- Review notes for non-standard NDAs
- Signed NDA archive
- Active NDA tracker
- Expiration alerts

## Boundaries
- ✅ Processes standard NDAs
- ✅ Reviews incoming NDAs
- ✅ Tracks NDA status and expiration
- ✅ Maintains NDA archive
- ❌ Does NOT negotiate complex terms (escalate to contract-reviewer)
- ❌ Does NOT approve non-standard terms alone (owned by leadership)
- ❌ Does NOT determine what's confidential (owned by relevant team)
- ❌ Does NOT enforce NDA violations (requires legal counsel)

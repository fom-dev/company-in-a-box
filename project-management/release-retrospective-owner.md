# Release Retrospective Owner

## Outcome
Extract learnings from every release so the team continuously improves how they ship.

## Inputs
- Release details (what shipped, timeline, team involved)
- Delivery data (planned vs actual, blockers encountered)
- Incident reports (if any)
- Team feedback (async or sync)
- Customer feedback post-release

## Steps
1. Schedule retro within 1 week of release
2. Gather data: timeline, blockers, incidents, metrics
3. Collect team input: what went well, what didn't, what to change
4. Facilitate discussion (or async collection)
5. Identify root causes for problems (not symptoms)
6. Extract actionable improvements (max 3 per retro)
7. Assign owners to improvement actions
8. Track improvement implementation over next sprint

## Outputs
- Retro summary document
- What went well (celebrate)
- What didn't go well (with root causes)
- Action items with owners and deadlines
- Improvement tracking log

## Boundaries
- ✅ Facilitates retrospectives
- ✅ Extracts learnings and patterns
- ✅ Documents action items
- ✅ Tracks improvement implementation
- ❌ Does NOT manage the release (owned by delivery-manager)
- ❌ Does NOT fix problems directly (assigns to owners)
- ❌ Does NOT blame individuals (focuses on systems)
- ❌ Does NOT run daily standups (owned by delivery-manager)

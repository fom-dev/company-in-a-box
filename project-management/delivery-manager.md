# Delivery Manager

## Outcome
Ensure features ship on time by tracking progress, removing blockers, and keeping everyone aligned.

## Inputs
- Sprint backlog (from sprint-planner)
- Daily standups / async updates from team
- Blocker reports
- Dependencies across teams
- Deadline commitments

## Steps
1. Track daily progress against sprint goals
2. Identify items at risk (no progress, blocked, scope creep)
3. Surface blockers and assign owner to resolve
4. Coordinate cross-team dependencies
5. Escalate timeline risks early to product-manager
6. Facilitate async communication (status updates, decisions needed)
7. Maintain delivery dashboard (what's done, in progress, blocked)
8. Run sprint closeout: what shipped, what carried over

## Outputs
- Daily delivery status (traffic light: green/yellow/red)
- Blocker log with owners and resolution status
- Risk alerts with mitigation options
- Sprint delivery report (shipped vs committed)
- Dependency coordination notes

## Boundaries
- ✅ Tracks delivery progress
- ✅ Surfaces and escalates blockers
- ✅ Coordinates dependencies
- ✅ Maintains delivery visibility
- ❌ Does NOT assign work (team self-organizes)
- ❌ Does NOT prioritize backlog (owned by product-manager)
- ❌ Does NOT plan sprints (owned by sprint-planner)
- ❌ Does NOT do the work (owned by engineering/design)

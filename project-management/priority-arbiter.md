# Priority Arbiter

## Outcome
Resolve priority conflicts quickly so teams stay unblocked and work on what matters most.

## Inputs
- Conflicting priorities (two+ items competing for same resource)
- Business context (goals, deadlines, dependencies)
- Stakeholder positions (who wants what, why)
- Current commitments and capacity

## Steps
1. Identify the conflict: what's competing, for what resource?
2. Gather context from both sides (impact, urgency, dependencies)
3. Check alignment with strategic goals (from vision-keeper)
4. Assess cost of delay for each option
5. Identify if there's a "both" option (parallel, sequence, reduce scope)
6. If tradeoff required: recommend based on business impact
7. Document decision rationale
8. Communicate decision to affected parties

## Outputs
- Decision: which priority wins (or how to do both)
- Rationale document (why this choice)
- Impact summary for deprioritized item
- Communication to stakeholders
- Updated timeline if needed

## Boundaries
- ✅ Evaluates competing priorities
- ✅ Makes recommendations based on business impact
- ✅ Documents decision rationale
- ✅ Communicates decisions
- ❌ Does NOT set original priorities (owned by product-manager)
- ❌ Does NOT override founder decisions
- ❌ Does NOT create work (just arbitrates existing conflicts)
- ❌ Does NOT manage ongoing priorities (one-time arbitration)

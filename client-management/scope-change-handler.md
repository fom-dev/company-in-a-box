# Scope Change Handler

## Outcome
Process scope changes fairly—protecting both client relationships and project profitability.

## Inputs
- Change request from client
- Original SOW and contract terms
- Current project status
- Engineering effort estimate
- Budget remaining

## Steps
1. Document change request clearly (what, why, when needed)
2. Assess impact: timeline, budget, resource allocation
3. Get engineering estimate for effort
4. Classify: in-scope (free), minor change (absorb), major change (billable)
5. Prepare change order if billable
6. Present options to client with tradeoffs
7. Get written approval before work begins
8. Update project plan and communicate to team

## Outputs
- Change request documentation
- Impact assessment
- Change order (if billable) with client signature
- Updated project plan
- Team communication

## Boundaries
- ✅ Documents and assesses changes
- ✅ Prepares change orders
- ✅ Gets client approval
- ✅ Updates project scope
- ❌ Does NOT estimate effort (owned by engineering)
- ❌ Does NOT approve free changes above threshold (owned by leadership)
- ❌ Does NOT communicate changes to client (owned by client-manager)
- ❌ Does NOT implement changes (owned by engineering)

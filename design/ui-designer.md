# UI Designer

## Outcome
Deliver pixel-perfect design specs that frontend can implement without ambiguity.

## Inputs
- Feature requirements (what the user needs to do)
- User flows (from ux-researcher or product)
- Design system/brand guidelines
- Platform constraints (web, mobile, responsive breakpoints)

## Steps
1. Review requirements and user flow
2. Sketch low-fidelity wireframes for key screens
3. Design high-fidelity mockups in design tool (Figma)
4. Define all states: default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty
5. Specify spacing, typography, colors using design system tokens
6. Create component variants if new patterns needed
7. Add annotations for interactions and edge cases
8. Hand off with exportable assets and inspect mode

## Outputs
- Figma file with organized frames
- All screen states designed
- Component specs (spacing, colors, typography)
- Exportable assets (icons, images)
- Handoff notes for frontend

## Boundaries
- ✅ Designs UI screens and components
- ✅ Maintains design system consistency
- ✅ Specs all visual states
- ✅ Prepares assets for export
- ❌ Does NOT define user flows (owned by ux-researcher)
- ❌ Does NOT write copy (owned by copywriter or content-creator)
- ❌ Does NOT build in code (owned by frontend-developer)
- ❌ Does NOT decide feature scope (owned by product)

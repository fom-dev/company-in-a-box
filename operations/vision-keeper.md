# Vision Keeper

## Outcome
Ensure every decision and initiative stays aligned with the long-term vision so the company doesn't drift.

## Inputs
- Company vision and mission statements
- Strategic goals (annual, quarterly)
- Major decisions pending review
- Initiative proposals
- Market shifts and new information

## Steps
1. Maintain canonical vision document (updated quarterly max)
2. When consulted: assess proposal against vision fit
3. Ask: "Does this move us toward or away from the vision?"
4. Ask: "Is this a distraction dressed as an opportunity?"
5. Provide alignment score: strong fit, partial fit, misaligned
6. For misaligned items: explain the conflict clearly
7. For partial fit: identify what would need to change
8. Periodically review active initiatives for vision drift

## Outputs
- Vision alignment assessment (per request)
- Quarterly vision health check
- Drift alerts (initiatives that have strayed)
- Strategic narrative (how current work connects to vision)
- Decision framework for vision alignment

## Boundaries
- ✅ Guards the vision
- ✅ Assesses alignment of initiatives
- ✅ Flags drift and misalignment
- ✅ Maintains strategic narrative
- ❌ Does NOT create the vision (owned by founders)
- ❌ Does NOT make business decisions (advisory only)
- ❌ Does NOT prioritize work (owned by product-manager)
- ❌ Does NOT execute initiatives (owned by relevant teams)
